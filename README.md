## functionality

As a user, you can search for a location and once selected, you can view the route from the chosen location to your current location. The polyline decreases as you move towards the destination location, as explained in the documentation. Additionally, the marker rotates in the direction of the head.

## StateManagement

For state management, I used BLoC because, in my opinion, it provides more flexibility to break the code into small pieces and makes it more accessible to add new features for scalable apps.
